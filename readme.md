# Neighborhood project

the goal for this is rather ambitious i think, basically openscad but with movement and stuff i dont have a super clear vision but yea, this will become more like "official" once i have stuff down but right now i need to actually have something built so yea

If you want latest version then build from source, yk just like git clone and then cargo run and you should be fine, the web port isnt up to date right now, it runs fine on native

I think ill call it ugoku or something like that but linksim isnt tuff ngl

ui is still coming but im learning rust still so i gotta learn bevy + rust not just bevy, which means things take longer

web port will be updated once i get a linkage editor setup


controls -
shift + right click + move mouse = orbit
shift + left click + move mouse = pan

you can also WASD for pan

+/- for zoom

also Q & E for primitive orbit 

space bar to change view projection mode (orthographic, perspective, orthographic2d)

left click to select joints
