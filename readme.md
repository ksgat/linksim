# Ugoku!

in order to use this make sure you have rust installed, and then cargo run, your exe will be built and then you can run accordingly

A position based dynamics (quasi)-kinematics simulator

Ugoku is an experimental simulation tool for building and animating(soon) mechanical linkages. Largely inspired by OpenSCAD, but with movement in mind, it lets you define structures via scripts and simulate their motion using position-based dynamics.

Itâ€™s still early days  the UI is a work in progress, the web port lags behind, and the name might change. Buhe goal is to make a programmable environment for exploring motion, linkages, constraints, and more.

Still heavy work in progress, also taking a quick break from development to focus my efforts elsewhere

Eventually i will implement all 507 mechanical movements from 507movements (dot) com.




controls -
shift + right click + move mouse = orbit
shift + left click + move mouse = pan

you can also WASD for pan

+/- for zoom

also Q & E for primitive orbit 

space bar to change view projection mode (orthographic, perspective, orthographic2d)

left click to select joints
